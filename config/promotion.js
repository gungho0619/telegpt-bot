ðŸ”· *What is LongLifeCoin?*

The main purpose is to help others because helping others is the foundation of happiness. We aim to help patients alleviate their suffering and benefit humanity.

LongLifeCoin is a cryptocurrency that supports the poor and those in need by providing access to Chinese herbal medicine and free clinics.

Our goal is to build free clinics or small hospitals where people can get treatments using 5-vegetable juice or 6-vegetable juice, a traditional Chinese medicine method.

ðŸ“¢ Visit: LongLifeCoin.com to learn more about this project.

We aim to gather $1,000,000 for this mission with 10^12 tokens priced at $1.5 each. Your support can help solve homelessness in America and improve the quality of life for many.
